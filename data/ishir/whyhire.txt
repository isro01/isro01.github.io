Written with utmost seriousnes (okay not THAT much)

1. I am an excellent co-worker with consistent work ethic. Also have great work playlists so late night work sessions will be fire!

2. Great at asking the simplest questions. Sometimes leads to judging looks, sometimes leads to simpler solutions to the original problem.

3. Will click cinematic potraits of co-workers in exchange for a slice or helping me out with pull request comments.

4. Might act out as the most negative person if everyone's positive, and vice-versa. I'm not sure if it's healthy but has helped keep a balance in team projects.
