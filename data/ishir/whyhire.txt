1. I am an excellent co-worker and I take pride in my work ethic. Also have great work playlists so late night work sessions will be fire!

2. Great at asking the simplest questions. Sometimes leads to judging looks, sometimes leads to simpler solutions to the original problem.

3. Have prior experience working with multi-disciplinary teams. Love working in a group, but can take up tasks solo as well.
